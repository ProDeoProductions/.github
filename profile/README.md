# Welcome to ProDeo Productions!

## About me:
I am an enthusiastic Christian who has many dreams and ideas to help people understand the Bible better. Unfortunately, I'm just a single person with limited abilities due to chronic illnesses, so for now I'm only working on a large Bible database on https://www.prodeodatabase.com. 

## About ProDeo Productions
If I ever manage to finish it or have people who'd like to help me with the database, I'd also love to work on a science fiction game based on biblical stories! The database is an insane amount of work, so for now that idea just remains exactly that, an idea. A few years ago, I had a big list of projects that I wanted to make under the name ProDeo Productions (or ProDeo Projects), but it got so incredibly overwhelming that I had to make the difficult decision of putting those ideas aside and just focus on my main goal: The Bible Database.

## Why the database?
I'm a visual learner. Reading line after line of who begat who is just a blurry string of words, but put it in a family tree and things get a lot clearer for me. Same goes for timelines, world maps, etc. I just want to help other visual learners by creating a website that contains all this information in a single place. The entire Bible is a big book, and I started somewhere in 2014. I've reworked the website twice and am currently still working hard on improving the website and adding info to the database. I'm not sure if I'll ever finish this project in my lifetime!

## Help needed
I could really use help with this project, so anyone who has an interest in the Bible and would like to help, please let me know! While GitHub is mainly used for programming, you do not necessarily need programming knowledge to help me out. Finding sources for historical events, scientific stuff, geographical information and anything else related to biblical information will help me out a lot. 

*I do need to mention that this project is my baby and has been for over 10 years, so I take it very seriously. I genuinely want to help other people with it.*
